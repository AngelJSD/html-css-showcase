# HTML and CSS

This repo contains a very simple frontend project that I made using html and css only. It doesn't contain any frontend logic such as form validation. Its main purpose is to show my knowledge of the following topics:

### HTML
- Semantic HTML
- Accesibility (usage of attributes that help the screen readers to read the content of the page)

### CSS
- BEM (Block__Element--Modifier) architecture
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Class selector
- Id selector
- Child selector (>)
- Pseudo-classes
- Pseudo-elements
